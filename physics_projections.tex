\chapter{Physics Projections 2023--2025}
\label{chap:physics_projections}

In this Chapter we present some of the key physics that sPHENIX will
deliver with the run plan for 2023--2025 that was detailed in
Chapter~\ref{chap:beam_use_proposal}.  The projected uncertainties
shown in the following sections have been determined for the 28
cryo-week scenarios. It is straightforward to rescale the
uncertainties to obtain projections for 24 cryo-week scenarios.  In
the case of nuclear modification factors, the results include
uncertainties in the numerator from the \auau or \pau running and the
denominator from the \pp reference data sets.  The physics projections
are split into Section~\ref{sec:jet} (Jet and Photon Physics),
Section~\ref{sec:upsilon} (Upsilon Physics), Section~\ref{sec:HF}
(Open Heavy Flavor Physics), and Section~\ref{sec:ColdQCD} (Cold QCD
Physics).

\section{Jet and Photon Physics}
\label{sec:jet}

Probing the quark-gluon plasma with precise jet, direct photon, and
hadron measurements is a core aspect of the sPHENIX scientific
program. Between 2023 and 2025, sPHENIX will collect high statistics
data samples to allow for detailed reconstructed jet measurements,
including jet yields, di-jet events, jet (sub-)structure and
properties, photon-tagged jet quenching measurements, and jet-hadron
correlations.  The projections in this Section are for light flavor
jets; statistical projections for $b$-quark jet yields and their
properties are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:HF}.

The projections in this section are based on perturbative QCD
calculations previously used in the sPHENIX MIE proposal
document~\cite{Adare:2015kwa} applied to the nominal running plan
proposed in Sec.~\ref{chap:beam_use_proposal}.  For \pp collisions, it
is assumed that all photons and jets can be efficiently selected by a
calorimeter trigger above a moderate $p_\mathrm{T}$ value, and that
the full high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ charged hadrons yield can be selected
indirectly via a jet trigger. For \auau collisions, it is assumed that
jets and charged hadrons will only be measured in Minimum Bias events,
but that the statistics for high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ photons can be fully
populated by a photon trigger in \auau data-taking.

  jets, photons, and charged hadrons in 0--10\% \auau events and \pp
  events, for the first three years of sPHENIX data-taking.}
\label{fig:jet_RAA_proj}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:jet_RAA_proj} (left) shows the projected total yield of
jets, direct photons, and hadrons in $p$+$p$ collisions and in 0--10\%
central Au+Au collisions, using a Glauber MC
simulation~\cite{Miller:2007ri} to translate \auau event yields to an
effective partonic luminosity. Overall suppression factors of
$R_\mathrm{AA} = 0.2$, $0.4$ and $1.0$ are assumed for hadrons, jets,
and photons in central \auau events. In the first three years, sPHENIX
will have kinematic reach out to $\approx 70$~GeV for jets, and
$\approx 50$~GeV for hadrons and photons.

As another way of indicating the kinematic reach of these probes, the
nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ for each is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:jet_RAA_proj} (right). For charged hadrons, due to their
strongly suppressed $R_\mathrm{AA}$, the comparison is generally
limited by \auau data. For jets, the comparison is initially limited
by the statistical uncertainties in \auau in 2023. However, after
additional \auau data-taking in 2025, the \pp reference data
becomes the limiting factor for jet measurements. For direct photons,
the comparison is always limited by the reference \pp data, even
before 2025 \auau data-taking. This is because photons, unlike jets
and hadrons, are not suppressed and can be triggered on in \auau. For
other centrality selections such as 10--20\%, the comparison generally
becomes limited by the \auau statistics rather than that in \pp.

The projection plots above indicate the total kinematic reach for
certain measurements, such as those which explore the kinematic
dependence of energy loss.  For other measurements, it is useful to
have a large sample of physics objects to study the properties of
their intra-event correlations, for example for jets (their internal
structure), photons (for photon+jet correlations), and hadrons (for
hadron-triggered semi-inclusive jet measurements). We illustrate the
total yields in sPHENIX under some example $p_\mathrm{T}$
thresholds. sPHENIX will record approximately $65\,000$ ($50\,000$)
jets with $p_\mathrm{T} > 40$~GeV in 0--10\% Au+Au (\pp events),
approximately $2\,400$ ($500$) direct photons with
$p_\mathrm{T} > 30$~GeV in 0--10\% \auau (\pp events), and
$4\,300$ ($6\,700$) charged hadrons with $p_\mathrm{T} > 25$~GeV in
0--10\% \auau (\pp events).

jet $v_2$ measurement in 10--30\% \auau events.

\section{Upsilon Physics}
\label{sec:upsilon}

High statistics measurements of Upsilon production with sufficient
precision for clear separation of the $\Upsilon(1s,2s,3s)$ states is a
key deliverable of the sPHENIX physics program.
Figure~\ref{fig:upsilon3years} shows the projected statistical
uncertainties for the $\Upsilon(1s)$ and $\Upsilon(2s)$ states as a
function of $p_{T}$ in 0-10\% central \auau collisions.  We note that
the $\Upsilon(3s)$ has so far not been observed in \pbpb collisions at
the Large Hadron Collider, and so might only result in an upper limit
from sPHENIX depending on the yields.

%Also, shown are results for the three-states assuming a particular model (!) for the nuclear modification factor as a function of centrality.   NEED FIGURE FROM TONY!

      cryo-weeks in each year of running.

\section{Open Heavy Flavor Physics}
\label{sec:HF}

Heavy-flavor quarks ($c$, $b$) play a unique role in studying QCD in
the vacuum as well as in the nuclear medium at finite temperature or
density. Their masses are much larger than the QCD scale
($\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$), the additional QCD masses due to chiral
symmetry breaking, and the typical medium temperature created at RHIC
and LHC ($T \sim 300$--500~MeV). Therefore, they are created
predominantly from initial hard scatterings and their production rates
are calculable in perturbative QCD. In combination with light sector
measurements as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:jet}, the large heavy
quark mass scale introduces additional experimental and theoretical
handles allowing one to study quark-QGP interactions in more detail
and to better test our understanding of the underlying physics,
including mass-dependent energy loss and collectivity in QGP. Thus
they can be used to study the QGP in a more controlled manner.
However, heavy-flavor signals in heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies
are relatively rare and current results from RHIC are sparse in
particular in the bottom sector.  Improving on these results requires
the sPHENIX capabilities of high precision and high data rate.

\end{figure}

sPHENIX, equipped with a state-of-the-art vertex tracker and high rate
streaming DAQ, will bring key heavy-flavor measurements at RHIC fully
into the precision era and place stringent tests on models describing
the coupling between heavy quarks and the QGP. In the first three
years of operation, sPHENIX will enable $B$-meson and $b$-jet
measurements covering the wide transverse momentum range from
$\sim$2--40~GeV/$c$, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:HF-inclusive-RAA} and
\ref{fig:HF-v2}, which is compared with current theory
calculations~\cite{Duke,TAMU,PHSD,CUJET,Huang:2013vaa,Ke:2020nsm}.  In
Fig.~\ref{fig:HF-inclusive-RAA}, the precise $B$-meson nuclear
modification measurements will cover $\pT <\sim$15~GeV/$c$, where
nuclear modifications for bottom quarks and light quarks are expected
to be quite different, through to the $b$-jet at much higher-\pT,
where the effect dues to the light and heavy quark mass difference is
less significant.  The current experimental results do not yet clarify
the detailed physics behind this transition.  In the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:HF-v2}, the elliptic flow $v_2$ measurements of the
$B$-meson made with unprecedented precision offer unique insights into
the coupling of the bottom quark to the medium.  Theoretical modeling
using the ``Brownian'' motion methodology requires that momentum
transfer for each interaction is much smaller than the heavy particle
mass~\cite{Moore:2004tg}. It is much better controlled for bottom
quarks compared to charm quarks~\cite{Das:2013kea}. Therefore,
precision bottom measurements over a wide momentum range, particularly
in the low-\pT region, can offer significant constraints on the heavy
quark diffusion transport parameter of the QGP medium along with its
temperature dependence. In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:HF-v2},
the $v_2$ measurement is further extended to the tens of GeV range,
where the path-length differential energy loss of the $b$-quark is
probed.

\end{figure}

With its large acceptance and multi-observable capability, the sPHENIX
experiment is well positioned to explore new heavy-flavor
correlations. Recently, the invariant mass of back-to-back
heavy-flavor jet pairs has been shown to be a promising experimental
observable for studying the propagation of quarks in the
QGP~\cite{Kang:2018wrs}. The 3-year projection for the nuclear
modification of the invariant mass for back-to-back $b$-jet pairs and
$b$-jet-light-jet super-ratio is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:HF-bjet-pair}. Comparing to predictions based on 10\%
variation on the coupling parameter, $g^{\textrm{med}}$, the sPHENIX
data will place stringent constraints on the $b$-quark coupling to the
QGP under this model.

% (Moved from streaming readout section, need rewritten....)
% The currently envisioned sPHENIX experiment is designed to take large statistics of calorimeter triggered events in the \pp collisions, which will sample 2 trillion delivered \pp collisions in the vertex acceptance of the silicon tracker (18\% of all collisions)~\cite{something}. For observables that utilize calorimeter for analysis, a trigger can usually be designed, such as leptonic decays at higher $p_T$, jets, photon, and their correlation observables. However, low-$p_T$  ($<10$~GeV$/c$) HF hadrons usually decay hadronically and leave relatively low signals in the calorimeters when compared with the underlying event. Therefore, they cannot be efficiently collected via calorimeter triggers, which have a hadron energy threshold of 10 GeV. Therefore, in the currently envisioned sPHENIX detector, there is no efficient way in triggering such events in the \pp collisions. And in the 15 kHz sPHENIX trigger bandwidth, one would only reasonable request around few kHz of the minimum bias \pp trigger for this new program. Assuming 50\% vertex range selection purity , 1 kHz M.B. trigger leads to recording $2\times10^{-4}$ of the delivered luminosity . This translates to quite limited statistics for these rare low-$p_T$ HF signals as quantified in Table X [Need table].
% This upgrade carries out the upgrade enabling the collection of a sufficient amount of minimum bias \pp events. That is 10\% delivered luminosity (see next Chapter), 200 billion events in vertex tracker acceptance, which is a factor of 500 improvements. This dataset enables a comprehensive low-$p_T$ hadron program as discussed in this subsection. The analysis for these HF hadronic channels does not require calorimeter information. Instead, they can be identified with the precision tracking detectors of sPHENIX (at $p_T$=5 GeV$/c$, $\sigma(p)/p=1\%$, $\sigma(DCA)<10$~$\mu$m ) via a combination of decay topology and invariant mass, as demonstrated for even the busiest events of Au+Au collisions through detailed simulation studies in~\cite{something}. 
 
% The non-prompt $D^0$ meson production is a clean channel to access b-quark via its decay chain. Using tracker data alone, both prompt and non-prompt $D^0$ can be reconstructed via the invariant mass and a multi-variable classification algorithm based on the decay topology, including the distance of closest approach ($DCA$) of tracks, the closeness between tracks, decay length and angle, as demonstrated in a worse background situation (A+A) in~\cite{something}. Together with the sPHENIX Au+Au dataset, this upgrade will enable the first precision measurement of nuclear modification of the B observable at RHIC via the non-prompt $D^0$ as highlighted in Figure~\ref{fig:RAA-D0}. Similar measurement will be expanded to the exclusive decay modes such as $B^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ (D^0 \rightarrow \pi^- K^+)$) (~1k events expected).

% With the extensive, inclusive dataset, the SRO upgrade will further enable novel highly differential observables, such as the $c$-quark correlation measurement by detecting pairs of $D^0$ mesons. 500k $D^0$ pairs will be recorded with the upgraded DAQ. Together with the planned Au+Au data, such dataset for Charm correlations will provide a unique handle in quantitatively understanding the diffusion of c-quarks in QGP~\cite{something}.

Recent RHIC and LHC data indicate significant enhancements of the
$\lambda_c$ baryon to $D^0$ meson production ratio in \pp, \pA and \aa
collisions~\cite{Adam:2019hpq}. However, the data at the RHIC is still
sparse and the reference $\Lambda_c/D$ ratio in the \pp collision is
missing at the RHIC energies, while the current model predictions
differ significantly. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lc-D0}, sPHENIX will
enable the first measurement of the $\Lambda_c/D$ in \pp collisions at
RHIC and provide the high precision heavy ion data to quantitatively
understand the enhancement of the charmed baryon/meson production
ratio and therefore charm hadronization in the QGP~\cite{something}.

\section{Cold QCD Physics}
\label{sec:ColdQCD}

The sPHENIX detector, designed to study the QGP with jet, photon and
heavy flavor probes, and with its trigger capabilities and high DAQ
rate capabilities, will provide key opportunities for cold QCD
measurements. These include a broad range of physics measurements with
transversely polarized beams and studies of transverse momentum
effects and hadronization in \pp and \pA collisions.   

%The main emphasis of the RHIC Spin program has been measurements of the gluon polarization in longitudinally polarized proton collisions. RHIC experiments discovered a significant gluon polarization in the gluon momentum fraction range $x>0.05$. Even with the future EIC data expected to precisely measure $\Delta G$ in the lower x region, RHIC data will remain a significant contributor at $x>0.05$. However, any significant improvement of $\Delta G$ measurements, compared to existing RHIC data (published and being analyzed), requires significant integrated luminosity (at least a few hundred pb$^{-1}$), which is not anticipated in the sPHENIX 3-year running scenario. Therefore in this document we focus on the measurements with transversely polarized beams.

\subsection {Transverse Spin Measurements}

In recent years, transverse spin phenomena have gained substantial
attention. The nature of significant transverse single spin
asymmetries (TSSAs) in hadron collisions, discovered more than 40
years ago at low center of mass energy ($\sqrt{s}=4.9$~GeV), and then
confirmed at higher energies up to $\sqrt{s}=500$~GeV and $p_T \sim
7$~GeV/$c$ at RHIC, has not yet been fully understood. Different
mechanisms are suggested to explain such asymmetries, involving
initial-state and final-state effects, in the collinear or
transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) framework. These descriptions have
deep connections to nucleon partonic structure and parton dynamics
within the nucleon, as well as spin-momentum correlations in the
process of hadronization. 

The TSSAs in direct photon and heavy flavor production probe the gluon
dynamics within a transversely polarized nucleon, described by the
tri-gluon correlation function in the collinear twist-3 framework,
which is connected with the gluon Sivers TMD parton distribution
function (PDF), thus far poorly constrained. The Sivers function
correlates the nucleon transverse spin with the parton transverse
momentum. 

The projected uncertainties for the midrapidity direct photon TSSAs compared to theoretical calculations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:AN_dp}. The direct photon sample here will be collected with an EMCal-based high-energy cluster trigger. 
%Asymmetry measurements in $D^0$ meson production through its hadronic decay will be done from a minimum bias (MB) sample collected with streaming readout. Figure~\ref{fig:AN-D0} shows the projected uncertainties for such a measurement.
The new capability of the sPHENIX streaming DAQ (detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:streaming_readout}) enables a high precision
measurement of $D^0$ TSSA in the mid-rapidity region as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:AN-D0}.  
%This observable is a unique probe of the twist-3 tri-gluon correlation function and gluon Sievers effect in the polarized proton, which opens a new window into the dynamics of gluons in hadrons [Reference to be updated].

\end{figure}

Another interesting channel related to the Sivers effect is the inclusive jet TSSA, which has not yet been measured at central rapidity. sPHENIX can provide high precision measurements with uncertainties on the level of a few times $10^{-4}$. While the opposite sign contribution of up and down quarks to Sivers asymmetry is expected to suppress the measured TSSA, tagging the leading hadron charge will preferentially enhance the contribution from fragmenting up or down quarks, and therefore will enable the flavor-separated measurements in the central rapidity kinematics.

Dijet measurements allow for direct access to parton intrinsic transverse momentum $k_T$. Again, charged tagging will enhance the effect from either up or down quarks, which otherwise will be essentially cancelled out. Recent STAR preliminary results showed a nonzero effect for charge-tagged jets. sPHENIX as a dedicated detector for jet and photon measurements is expected to significantly contribute to these measurements and to extend it to photon-jet measurements, which essentially isolate the quark-gluon scattering process at leading order, thus giving access to the gluon Sivers effect.

Another possible origin of the observed TSSAs is the Collins mechanism, which correlates the transverse polarization of a fragmented quark to the angular distribution of hadrons within a jet. This gives access to the transversity distribution in the proton, which can be interpreted as the net transverse polarization of quarks within a transversely polarized proton. Along with the unpolarized PDF and helicity PDF, transversity is one of three leading-twist PDFs, least known at the moment. The integral in $x$ over the valence quark transversity distribution defines the tensor charge, a fundamental value calculable in lattice QCD, therefore enabling the crucial comparison of experimental measurements with ab-initio theoretical calculations.

Measuring angular distributions of dihadrons in the collisions of
transversely polarized protons, couples transversity to the so-called
``interference fragmentation function'' (IFF) in the framework of
collinear factorization. The IFF describes a correlation between the
spin of an outgoing quark and the angular distribution of a hadron
pair that fragments from that quark.  A comparison of the transversity
signals extracted from the Collins effect and IFF measurements will
explore questions about universality and factorization breaking. 

The first nonzero Collins and IFF asymmetries in \pp collisions have
been observed by the STAR collaboration at midrapidity and shown to be
invaluable to constrain the transversity distribution. sPHENIX, with
its excellent hadron and jet calorimetric trigger capabilities coupled
with its high-rate DAQ capabilities, is expected to deliver
high-statistics samples for both Collins and IFF
asymmetries. sPHENIX's capability to collect a significant 
data sample with streaming readout will allow us to extend the charged
dihadron measurements for IFF asymmetries from the barrel region
($|\eta|<1$) to more forward kinematics up to $\eta=2$.  
%Fig.* shows projected uncertainties for IFF asymmetries [hopefully we'll get them].


\subsection {Transverse Spin: \pp vs \pA}

$p\uparrow$$+$A collisions at RHIC provide unique opportunities to
study spin effects in a nuclear environment. These studies may provide
new insights into the origin of the observed TSSAs and a unique tool
to investigate the rich phenomena behind TSSAs in hadronic
collisions. TSSAs measured in polarized $p$+A collisions moreover
offer a new approach to studying small-system collisions, in which
numerous surprising effects have been observed in recent years. 

First RHIC results from the 2015 RHIC run showed a puzzling evolution
of the TSSA from \pp to \pAl and then \pAu. While STAR's
preliminary result for $\pi^{0}$ asymmetry in forward rapidity (with
$0.2<x_F<0.7$) showed no significant nuclear dependence, PHENIX's
positively charged hadron asymmetries in the intermediate rapidity
range (with $0.1<x_F<0.2$) discovered a strong nuclear dependence in
the TSSA, from $A_N \sim 0.03$ in $p+p$ collisions to a value
consistent with zero in \pAu collisions. No clear explanation for
such a behavior has been offered at the moment. Obviously, more data,
differentiated in $p_T$ and $x_F$, would be highly desirable. sPHENIX
is able to collect much more data in this channel, with fine binning,
which is expected to provide crucial information on the nature of
TSSAs in hadronic collisions and on understanding of the spin probe---
nucleus interaction, a novel topic directly associated with RHIC's
unique ability to collide polarized protons with nuclei. 

Figure~\ref{fig:AN_h} shows the projected uncertainties for sPHENIX,
based on MB data collected with the streaming readout. The sPHENIX
tracking system will provide us with charged hadron measurements in
the pseudorapidity range up to $\eta=2$, which overlaps with the
PHENIX range, where the strong nuclear effect was observed
($1.2<\eta<2.4$).

The other measurements (e.g. Collins and IFF asymmetries) will also be
compared between \pp and \pA systems and may potentially bring new
surprises. 


\subsection {Unpolarized Measurements}

A number of cold QCD measurements that do not require beam
polarization are planned in \pp and \pA collisions. Fig~\ref{fig:jet_RpA_proj} demonstrates the kinematic reach for inclusive jet, photon, and charged hadron measurements in this system via the expected total yields and the projected uncertainties in the nuclear modification factor $R_{p\mathrm{A}}$. sPHENIX will deliver sufficient data to measure jets out to $\approx 70$~GeV, and charged hadrons and direct photons out to $\approx 45$~GeV.

Hadronization
studies will be performed with hadron-in-jet measurements,
multidifferential in momentum fraction $z$ of the jet carried by the
produced hadron, in the transverse momentum $j_T$ of the hadron with
respect to the jet axis, and in the angular radial profile $r$ of the
hadron with respect to the jet axis. This includes studies for both
light quark and heavy quark hadrons. Comparison of \pp and pA
collisions will provide information on the nuclear modification of
hadronization processes. Measurements performed by PHENIX of
nonperturbative transverse momentum effects and their nuclear
modifications in back-to-back dihadron and photon-hadron correlations,
will be extended to dijet and photon-jet measurements in sPHENIX.
These measurements will help to separate the effects associated with
intrinsic parton momentum $k_T$ in the nucleon or nucleus and
fragmentation transverse momentum $j_T$. These correlation
measurements may also help to probe theoretically predicted
factorization breaking effects within the
transverse-momentum-dependent framework. Upsilon and \jpsi
polarization measurements will shed further light on heavy quarkonium
production mechanisms.
